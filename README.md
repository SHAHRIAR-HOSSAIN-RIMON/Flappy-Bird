# Flappy Bird (Java Version)

This is a Java-based recreation of the classic mobile game **Flappy Bird**. The goal is to control a bird, navigating it through a series of pipes while avoiding obstacles. Try to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score!

## Features
- **Simple Gameplay**: Press the spacebar to make the bird rise, avoid pipes, and rack up the highest score.
- **Customizable Difficulty**: The speed and spacing of the pipes can be adjusted by modifying the code (see below).
- **Graphics & Sound**: Enjoy basic 2D graphics and sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.
- **High Score Tracking**: The game tracks your best score, so you can always try to beat it!

## Requirements
- Java 8 or later
- An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or command-line setup to run Java programs

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE or editor.
3. Run the `FlappyBird.java` file to start the game.

## Controls
- Press **Space** to make the bird rise.
- Avoid hitting the pipes or the ground!

## Customizing Difficulty
The game's difficulty (pipe speed and spacing) can be customized by modifying the code:

- **Pipe Speed**: Change the value of `PIPE_VELOCITY` in the code to adjust how fast the pipes move.
- **Pipe Spacing**: Modify the spacing between pipes by adjusting the `PIPE_SPACING` constant in the code.

You can find these constants in the game's source file (`FlappyBird.java`).
